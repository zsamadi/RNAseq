# RNAseq
## Analyzing scRNA  sequencing dataset with the scanpy python package.

This Python notebook performs an analysis of the cell types and their marker genes on provided [GSE118614_Smart](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118614) dataset. Minor modifications were performed on the dataset to make it proper to be read with scabpy read_10x_mtx command. All necessary files are included in sdata folder, except the matrix.mtx file which I couldn't upload here due to its large size. This file can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yBlJ-lbGgYED3P_ziVffwZR1PmVDsFnT/view?usp=sharing), and should also be copied into [sdata](https://github.com/zsamadi/RNAseq/tree/main/sdata) folder before running [retina_report](https://github.com/zsamadi/RNAseq/blob/main/retina_report.ipynb) notebook.
