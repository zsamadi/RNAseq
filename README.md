# RNAseq
## Analyzing scRNA  sequencing dataset with the scanpy python package.

[retina_smart](https://github.com/zsamadi/RNAseq/blob/main/retina_smart.ipynb) Jupytert notebook performs an analysis of the cell types and their marker genes on the [GSE118614_Smart](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118614) dataset. Minor modifications were made on the dataset to make it proper to be read with scabpy read_10x_mtx command. All necessary files are included in [sdata](https://github.com/zsamadi/RNAseq/tree/main/sdata) folder, except the [matrix.mtx](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yBlJ-lbGgYED3P_ziVffwZR1PmVDsFnT&export=download) file which I couldn't upload here due to its large size. This file should be downloaded, and copied into [sdata](https://github.com/zsamadi/RNAseq/tree/main/sdata) folder before running the notebook.
